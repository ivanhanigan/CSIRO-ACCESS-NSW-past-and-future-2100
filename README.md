Here are the ACCESS 1.3 projections (historical and future to
2100 based on RCP8.5). Remember that there is a long list of
acknowledgements to add to any publication that uses these layers. Let
me know how you go with that. Cheers Lu PS For some reason the date
names disappeared, the file names state first and final dates for the
time series, and there is one observation per month.

This code repo is the documenation of my code to prepare future drought data for the paper 'Open Software - Restricted Data'.

The publication of this analytic code makes the analysis more transparent and accessible by the research community. The analytic data are available on request.
